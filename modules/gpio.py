import RPi.GPIO as GPIO

# Setup GPIO pins and initial states
def setup():
    GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BOARD)  # or GPIO.BCM, depending on your pin numbering system
    # Set up each pin you plan to use
    # For example:
    GPIO.setup(11, GPIO.OUT, initial=GPIO.LOW)
    GPIO.setup(13, GPIO.OUT, initial=GPIO.LOW)
    GPIO.setup(15, GPIO.OUT, initial=GPIO.LOW)
    GPIO.setup(19, GPIO.OUT, initial=GPIO.LOW)
    # Add setup for more pins as needed

# Write to a pin
def write_pin(pin, state):
    GPIO.output(pin, state)

# Read from a pin
def read_pin(pin):
    return GPIO.input(pin)

# Clean up at the end of your program
def cleanup():
    GPIO.cleanup()

# Additional functions as needed for your specific use cases, like motor control, can be added here.
